WordPress for BlackBerry 
===================================
  
Introduction
------------

This source distribution allows you to modify and build WordPress for BlackBerry yourself.
If you just want to install and use WordPress for BlackBerry, you probably don't want
this distribution, but want to install the pre-built version available from the WordPress website:

  http://blackberry.wordpress.org

You can get all info to build the app in the how_to_build.txt file.

Please see the WordPress for BlackBerry website for up-to-date information on the project.

- WordPress for BlackBerry uses a modified version of kXML-RPC <http://sourceforge.net/projects/kxmlrpc/>,
which in turn uses the kXML parser <http://sourceforge.net/projects/kxml/>. These two
products are licensed under licensed under the GNU Library or Lesser General Public License (LGPL).
See the respective web pages for a copy of the license. The modified source code for
kXML-RPC is included with this source distribution, in the "thirdparty" source directory.
- WordPress for BlackBerry uses a small number of classes from LogicMail <http://logicmail.org/>. 
Those classes are used for characters encoding.
