WordPress for BlackBerry Building HOW-TO:
---------------------------------------
This file contains the instructions to build the source code provided with the zip package wordpress-src-1.0.0.zip

1. Required tools

    - Download and install Apache Ant: http://ant.apache.org/ (version 1.7)
    - Download and install Sun Java Wireless Toolkit: http://java.sun.com/products/sjwtoolkit/ (version 2.5.2)
    - Download and install Apache Antenna: http://antenna.sourceforge.net/ (version 1.0.1)
    - Download and install Blackberry JDE: http://na.blackberry.com/eng/developers/ (version 4.5.0)
    - Download and install bb-ant-tools: http://bb-ant-tools.sourceforge.net/main (version 1.1)

2. Required certificates

   WordPress for BlackBerry uses restricted APIs provided by RIM. For
   the application to work on real devices, it is necessary to sign it with a
   RIM certificate. Signature keys are provided directly by RIM. The application
   uses all the APIs but the crypto ones.

3. Pre-Build process configuration

3.1 Unzip the package into your working directory (<blackberry-dir>)

3.2 Open build.properties file in your editor

3.3 Set the right values for:
    Your blackberry JDE home:
    - rim.home.os42=<JDE-home>
      Example: rim.home=C:/Program Files/Research In Motion/BlackBerry JDE 4.2.1

    - rim.home.os47=<JDE-home>
      Example: rim.home=C:/Program Files/Research In Motion/BlackBerry JDE 4.7.0

    - Your signature password. This password is provided by RIM together with
      the certificates.
      Example: bb.sigtool.password=XXXXX

    - Your build type: default value is release but you may want to enable the debug options
      Example: build.type=release

    Save the file and exit.

3.4 Make sure bb-ant-tools.jar is accessible by ant. We suggest you to copy it
    into your <ant-home>\lib directory

5. Building the source
5.1 Open a command prompt and go to the directory <blackberry-dir>/build
5.2 Type "ant release" and press ENTER to build the client. The build process
    generates the required cod files. There are two sets of cod files:

    - <blackberry-dir>/output/xxx/release contains cod files which are suitable for
      the emulator (they are not broken into chunks by rapc). xxx can be os42 or
      os47.

    - <blackberry-dir>/output/xxx/release/ota contains the cod files suitable for
      OTA installation. xxx can be os42 or os47.

    In both directories there is a proper jad file for the installation.

5.3 "ant usage" shows the target supported by the common build descriptor.
    This is usually not required by standard building.
    
6. Deploying the application
6.1 Add the deploy.application definition to the build.properties to activate
    the deploy task:
    - deploy.username defines the remote username
    - deploy.host defines the remote host
    - deploy.remotePath defines the remote path to which the application should be
      deployed (new created if it doesn't exist)
    - deploy.path defines the web path to the application (to be replaced into the 
      jad file)
    - deploy.host.port defines the remote host port
    The password will be required during the task.
